Let me introduce a bit about myself. I am Aulia Khilmi Rizgi, and you can call me "Khilmi" or キルミ in Japanese pronunciation. I am a robotic enthusiast which currently pursuing a master's degree in mechanical systems engineering at Tokyo Metropolitan University. I love robotics since I know I can do and create everything through robots and automation, of course, programming was my first love. But since I know, I can solve problems with programming and make them real with robots, I tried to learn more about it. Moreover, I also love to work as a team because it will create a better result instead of doing everything by myself. I am a team player which always wants to create a better environment, a better approach, and a better result for everyone to create a very useful robots now and future.
