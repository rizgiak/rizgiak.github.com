<h3>Years of Involvement: Oct 2019 - Jan 2021</h3>

<h2>Summary</h2>
* Worked as RnD Mid-Level Software Engineer to collaborate with Software, Firmware, Electronic, and Mechanic Team to build a robot that can perform aspirate/dispense and mix in pre-defined microplate in microvolume.
* Responsible to design the algorithm for liquid handling robot in Linux environment by implementing clean code and design pattern in C# and C++.
* Fixed some bugs of the former code related to robot decision making.

<h2>Contribution</h2>
* (Team) Developed an object recognition algorithm by using blob detection to recognize the number and position of each tip with the maximum number of tips is 384.
* (Team) Developed a system to recognize unordered, unwanted fall down tips by employing TensorFlow and Coral.ai to make the robot to be able to avoid a collision by stopping the sequence.
* Created an algorithm to make the system to be able to enter recovery mode after a collision happened, which previously should reboot the system.
