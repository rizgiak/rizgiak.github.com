<h2>Contribution</h2>
* Lead programmer through C and C++ for Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Robot Communication, and Motion Control in ROS Platform.
* Developed five autonomous humanoid robot that has an ability to be a soccer player (walk, wake up from fall, recognize and shoot the ball, coordinate, and self- positioning inside the field) for humanoid soccer competition.
* Created a system to recognize the object inside the field by implementing machine learning.
* Created an optimized algorithm with cascaded finite state machines to reduce the time of self-decision.
* Developed a debugging system through wireless communication for all robots during soccer competition.
* Team leader from 2017 until 2019.
