<h2>Contribution</h2>
* Developed two-fingers gripper hand that has an ability to do in-hand manipulation by its active joint on the fingertips while moving an uncommon-shaped object from initial to the desired place.
* Increased the success ratio to 100% by creating analysis on force control, object surface, and pressure while performing the sequential movement.
* Created a visualization on RViz and simulation on Gazebo to make it easier to debug and compare the theoretical approach.
