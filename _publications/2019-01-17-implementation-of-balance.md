<b>Abstract:</b> This paper investigates balancing control of a humanoid robot in soccer application. Many works have been developed to solve balancing control using specific body parts movements while in a standing position. While for small disturbance have shown well, but for quite large disturbance has limited performance. In this paper, we focus on using the slight movement of a robot when quite large disturbance is applied. The robot slightly moves its position to the same direction of the disturbance. Slightly moves of the robot seems more natural with how human perform balancing when receive quite large disturbance. We implement this on our humanoid robot soccer platform. This method is to adjust the step position of the humanoid robot's leg when getting external perturbation to remain the robot in a standing condition. By reprocessing the inverted pendulum control formula, we get the relation between the angular acceleration and the step that the robot should perform. Experiments show that with this strategy our robot platform can prevent itself from falling as twice as better than before. Our method has been successfully applied in the real humanoid robot for robot soccer competition and achieve a remarkable result.
